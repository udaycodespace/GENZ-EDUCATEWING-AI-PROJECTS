## 📁 Project 1: Sentiment Analysis Using CNN (NLP)

### 📌 Description

This project explores how **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** can be applied to classify text sentiment from movie reviews. The objective is to build a model that predicts **positive or negative** sentiment using **word embeddings** and **1D convolution layers**.

### 🛠️ Key Components

- **Dataset**: IMDB Movie Reviews (Keras)  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, scikit-learn  
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Stopword removal, Padding  
- **Model**: CNN with GlobalMaxPooling, Dropout, and Sigmoid  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC, Confusion Matrix  

🔗 **GitHub Source**: [SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_CNN/](https://github.com/udaycodespace/GENZ-EDUCATEWING-AI-PROJECTS/tree/main/SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_CNN)

✅ This is a **standalone project** and includes code, sample output, and evaluation.

## 📁 Project 2: YOLO-based Object Detection (Computer Vision)

### 📌 Description

This project implements **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** for detecting and classifying objects in real-time. The focus is on training or running **pre-trained YOLOv8 models** to locate objects in images or video frames using **bounding boxes**.

### 🛠️ Key Components

- **Dataset**: COCO / PASCAL VOC (or custom images)  
- **Tools**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), OpenCV, Python  
- **Model Type**: Pre-trained or fine-tuned YOLOv8  
- **Evaluation**: mAP (Mean Average Precision), IOU, FPS  

🔗 **GitHub Source**: [OBJECT_DETECTION_YOLO/](https://github.com/udaycodespace/GENZ-EDUCATEWING-AI-PROJECTS/tree/main/YOLO_Based_Object_Detection/code)  
📓 **Colab Notebook**: [yolo_object_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/udaycodespace/GENZ-EDUCATEWING-AI-PROJECTS/blob/main/YOLO_Based_Object_Detection/code/yolo_object_detection.ipynb)

✅ This project is now **live** and includes code and output screenshots.
