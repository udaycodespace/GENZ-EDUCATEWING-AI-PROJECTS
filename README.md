## 📁 Project 1: Sentiment Analysis Using CNN (NLP)

### 📌 Description
This project explores how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be applied to classify text sentiment from movie reviews. The objective is to build a model that predicts **positive** or **negative** sentiment using word embeddings and 1D convolution layers.

### 🛠️ Key Components
- Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews (Keras)
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, scikit-learn
- Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword removal, Padding
- Model: CNN with GlobalMaxPooling, Dropout, and Sigmoid
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC, Confusion Matrix

🔗 GitHub Source: [`SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_CNN/`](https://github.com/udaycodespace/GENZ-EDUCATEWING-AI-PROJECTS/tree/main/SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_CNN)

✅ This is a **standalone project** and includes code, sample output, and evaluation.

## 📁 Project 2: YOLO-based Object Detection (Computer Vision)

### 📌 Description
This project implements **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for detecting and classifying objects in real-time. The focus is on training or running pre-trained YOLOv8 models to locate objects in images or videos using bounding boxes.

### 🛠️ Key Components
- Dataset: COCO / PASCAL VOC (or custom images)
- Tools: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), OpenCV, Python
- Model Type: Pre-trained or fine-tuned YOLOv8
- Evaluation: Mean Average Precision (mAP), IOU, FPS

🔗 GitHub Source: *(Coming Soon – Folder: `OBJECT_DETECTION_YOLO/`)*

⚠️ This project is under progress and will be added shortly.

## 🧪 How to Run Projects

> 💡 Recommended: Run on **Google Colab** for smooth experience with GPU.

### ▶️ Run Sentiment Analysis
```bash
# Colab notebook path
SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_CNN/code/Sentiment_Analysis_Using_CNN.ipynb
```
Runtime → Change to GPU  
Click **"Run All"**  
Model trains in ~3–5 minutes.

### ▶️ Run YOLO Object Detection
Instructions will be added once project is uploaded.
